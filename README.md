# Covid Advisory
We've made a website which is accessible by both normal and differently abled users for an example , one of its fea=tues is that this website has a functionality of speaking out the content which enables us to convey the useful information even those users who don't have the privilage to see this beautiful world, so that they can use this website just like all other users and feel that they are not alone in this world.
The clean UI enables to everyone to easily access the Covid Advisories.
